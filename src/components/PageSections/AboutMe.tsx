          This is the section where I talk about myself... what would you like
          to know? Am I interesting? Maybe, maybe not. But you're here, so I
          guess I'll tell you anyway.

        <p className="mb-8">
          After spending the first 11 years of my career working in Recruiting &
          Human Resources primarily focusing on recruiting technical talent, I
          finally decided to take the plunge myself to become a Software
          Engineer! Thankfully, the company I worked for had a great platform to
          help its team members transition to new roles. Initially, I was mostly
          self taught, going through a few different online coding programs.
          Once I formally moved into Product Engineering at work, I was also
          able to go through an extensive mentorship program designed to level
          up its junior engineers.

        <p className="mb-8">
          Since then I haven't looked back, and I've worked on websites,
          internal services, batch jobs, you name it! I'm super grateful for the
          opportunity I had to become and engineer, and I've loved every second
          of it! Here's to learning more!
